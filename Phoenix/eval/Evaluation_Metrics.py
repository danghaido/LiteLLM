        In this task, you will be presented with a query, a reference text and an answer. The answer is
        generated to the question based on the reference text. The answer may contain false information. You
        must use the reference text to determine if the answer to the question contains false information,
        if the answer is a hallucination of facts. Your objective is to determine whether the answer text
        contains factual information and is not a hallucination. A 'hallucination' refers to
        an answer that is not based on the reference text or assumes information that is not available in
        the reference text.
